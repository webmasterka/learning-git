        <h1> Ed Sheeran - Miss You </h1>
            <p> Shock, horror I'm down
                Lost, you're not around
                There's a lump in my chest that
                Sends cold through my head and 
                My mind shuts sound out
                I'm an auto pilot
                And my tounge's gone silent
                Just switch it off and lay it down
                Lay it down
                Next to me 
                
                I don’t know when I lost my mind
                Maybe when I made you mine
                Ooooohh
                I don’t know when I lost my mind
                Maybe it was every time
                You said, you said, you said
                That I miss you 
                That I miss you
                
                These words mean nothing to me
                I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
                These three words are aching
                Come strip and suffocating
                My mind is racing
                With the picture I'm painting
                And my belly sick to its stomach
                When I remember all the time
                He was with you when you laid it down
                You lay down
                Next to me
                
                 I don’t know when I lost my mind
                Maybe when I made you mine
                Ooooohh
                I don’t know when I lost my mind
                Maybe it was every time
                You said, you said, you said
                That I miss you, more than I let on 
                I kissed you, far too long 
                I’ll let go, as soon as you do see I know
                We’re not through
                </p>
